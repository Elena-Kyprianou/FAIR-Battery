How to contribute
*****************

We are currently testing and troubleshooting the first beta release. There is no written roadmap, or any
long-term plan except for fixing all the glitches in the current code. If you see room for improvement
and would like to scratch your itch, please feel free to fork the `source Code <https://github.com/sanlifaez/labphew>`_.

Please consider the `labphew strategic choices <introduction/labphew strategic choices>`_  if you are considering
a major expansion on the code.

Other small issues can be reported via the `issue tracker <http://github.com/sanlifaez/labphew/issues>`_

Adding examples
---------------
If you have customized labphew for your own project, please consider stripping your additional code in to
a simplified example that can be added to the examples. Most `examples <examples>`_ are CUI or CLI `views <labphew.view>`_ that run on the
currently supported real or dummy devices.
