# FAIR-Battery

Software and design for building an open-hardware redox-flow battery from the Center for Unusual Collaborations [CUCo]

## Battery Hardware

[WIP]

## Testing Software

The main purpose of providing testing software is to standardize tests as much as possible, making results much easier
to compare. The software works on any major computer platform, and binaries can be found here:

The software is a fork of the Labphew project: https://github.com/SanliFaez/labphew

## Testing Hardware

The battery testing software is currently designed around specific hardware, namely a Digilent Analog Discovery 2 (AD2),
a custom charging and discharging circuit, and for impedance spectroscopy, the Analog Discovery Impedance Analyzer Module, an
extension compatible with the AD2.
