Supported devices
*****************

The current version of labphew has been tested with the the following devices. The existing controllers do not
support all the features, but it is rather easy to expand on those given the available documentation of the
official drivers.

Cameras
^^^^^^^

+ Basler series: `Basler <https://www.baslerweb.com/en/>`_ provides a very large variety of cameras with a unified communication interface and an `official python wrapper <https://github.com/basler/pypylon>`_.

Data acquisition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

+ Analog discovery 2: A `digilent <https://store.digilentinc.com/>`_ compact and relatively low cost USB oscilloscope with a lot of `in-built capabilities <https://store.digilentinc.com/analog-discovery-2-100msps-usb-oscilloscope-logic-analyzer-and-variable-power-supply/>`_


Wishlist
^^^^^^^^

Even though the devices that are currently supported by labphew are not that expensive in comparison with most scientific instuments, they are still not the most affordable choices. Therefore, we wish to add support for cheapers devices as we develop labphew further.

+ Arduino
+ generic USB camera

Suggestions for exact models (and why you think so) are very welcome!
