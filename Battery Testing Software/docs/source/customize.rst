Customization
*************

Every measurement setup of protocol has its own logic and requirements.
Therefore, unless you have very basic requirements for your measurements, labphew is meant to be
hacked/customized/edited before is can match your needs. If you are an experienced python programmer,
you can customize labphew by editing the code at any level you need. Hopefully, there is enough value
in the current code that helps you not to start from a blank page.

If you are still in the learning phase, or would like to stay compatible with the existing modules of labphew
these recommendations might help you in getting your desired features rather quickly.
